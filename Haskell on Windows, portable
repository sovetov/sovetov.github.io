# Haskell on Windows, portable

Based on: https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/

Principles (most important first):
- Understand what is going on
- Verify where possible
- Portable (non-invasive)
- Automated where possible

- MSYS2
    - Download a self-extracting archive from https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases
    - For example, https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2023-10-26/msys2-base-x86_64-20231026.sfx.exe
    - Verify checksum: `certutil -hashfile msys2-base-x86_64-20231026.sfx.exe sha256`
    - Extract by running executable `msys2-base-x86_64-20231026.sfx.exe`
- GHCup
    - Download from https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghcup/
    - For example, https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghcup/0.1.20.0/x86_64-mingw64-ghcup-0.1.20.0.exe
    - Or by the URL to the latest version https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghcup/x86_64-mingw64-ghcup.exe
